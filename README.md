# Heat-Plots-for-Homotopy
Create heat plots to show the continuous transformation of one function into another

Each of the .mpl files are necessary for the package to work.

The Maple worksheet file serves as a tutorial for how to use the package. It illustrates by using the homotopies from the following articles:
